<br>
Description:
The program, called Freezer Keeper, uses a MySQL database with a local host URL. Its purpose is to address the challenge of keeping track of storage dates for home-refrigerated foods, which have short time limits and are difficult to manage. The program helps users store food for appropriate dates, thereby keeping it fresh for longer periods.

1. Purpose<br />
**Hard to keep up the storage date**
 * There are short time limits for home-refrigerated foods and hard to follow up on the storage date.
 * To keep the freshness of the food longer by storing it for an appropriate date.
 * This program helps the user to update the refrigerated/frozen food list so that they can get an alert by upcoming of the storage date.

2. Features<br />
**Get the upcoming expiration date of each food item**
 * Users can choose the food type (salad, meats, ham, shellfish, fish, eggs, soups/stews, leftovers, etc.), and storage type (refrigerator, freezer).
 * By the user input, the program tells the storage date and estimated expiration date of each food item (Storage data is referenced from the Food Safety Government, url: https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/cold-food-storage-charts).
 * Users can easily add/delete/search their foods and the user name.
 * Foods are differentiated by the users.
 * This program shows the upcoming expiration date of each food item (within 3 days).

3. Assumptions/Expectations<br />
**Diminishing food waste and making the eco-friendly environment**
 * Due to the alert of the upcoming expiration date, the consumer can smartly schedule their grocery shopping and spends less on their grocery.
 * Consumers can use the refrigerator space efficiently.
 * These notifications can help keep home-refrigerated foods from spoiling which leads to diminishing food waste.
