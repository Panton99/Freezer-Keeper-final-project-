# Final project - Freezer Keeper

Program name: Freezer keeper 
Used MySQL database with local host URL. 

Why I make this?
-	There is short time limits for home-refrigerated foods and hard to follow up the storage date.
-	To keep the freshness of the food longer by storing for appropriate date.
-	This program helps the user to update the refrigerated/freezed food list so that they can get alert by upcoming of the storage date.

What is the program about?
-	User can choose the food type (salad, meats, ham, shellfish, fish, eggs, soups/stews, leftovers, etcs...), and storage type (refrigerator, freezer).
-	By the user input, the program tells the storage date and estimated expiration date to the user (Storage date is referenced from the Food Safety Government).
-	User can easily add/delete/search their foods.
-	The list has the user's name so that foods are differentiated by the users.
-	This program shows upcoming expiration date lists to the user.

What to expect from this program?
-	Due to the alert of upcoming expiration date, consumer can smartly schedule the grocery shopping and spends less on their grocery.
-	Consumer can use the refrigerator space efficiently.
-	These notifications can help keep the home-refrigerated foods from spoiling which leads to diminish the food waste.
